Bineral is a coffee soil and leave mineral test result intepreter I developed for project Bobon - a non-profit project aims to make scientific coffee cultivation knowledge accessible to all Vietnamese farmers. Bineral uses ReactJs and Material-UI.

The web app compares soil analysis results to Arabica coffee tree's optimal content. From there, the suggested amount of fertilizers is also calculated.
